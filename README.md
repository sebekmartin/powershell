# Welcome
This repository is created for storing powershell scripts, which I created for some of my needs, while administering cloud or on-premises systems.  
Those are mainly short and simple scripts, but can be sometimes very helpful and can save a lot of time.  
Most of them are created by merging commands or some hints on the internet.
